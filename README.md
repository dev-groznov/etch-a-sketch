# Etch-a-Scetch
You can draw here: simply hover your mouse over the white space, and it will fill with a random color. Each time you hover, the block will also fill with a random color, but it will become darker.

There are also two buttons on the page:
1. Clear - clears the canvas
2. Change number of cells - changes the number of cells in a row
